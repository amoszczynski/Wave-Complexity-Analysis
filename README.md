# Wave-Complexity-Analysis
Given a .wav file, return a quantitative measure of the complexity of the sound wave at a point of max amplitude

Use included .wav files to test:  
sine.wav --> sine wave  
square.wav --> square wave  
triangle.wav --> triangle wave  
cmaj.wav --> c major chord on guitar  
orchestra.wav --> piece of orchestral music  
noise.wav --> white (random) noise  
overtone.wav --> overtone singing  
overtone1.wav --> overtone singing  
singing.wasv --> regular singing (to compare to overtone singing)
