# Wave-Complexity-Analysis
Given a .wav file, return a quantitative measure of the complexity of the sound wave at a point of max amplitude

Use included .wav files to test:
sine.wav --> sine wave
square.wav --> square wave
triangle.wav --> triangle wave
cmaj.wav --> c major chord on guitar
orchestra.wav --> piece of orchestral music
